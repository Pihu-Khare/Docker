The objective of this exercise is to investigate and showcase the concept of network isolation in Docker containers. Through this experiment, we will analyze how containers that are part of the same custom bridge network are able to communicate seamlessly with each other, whereas those assigned to different networks remain isolated and unable to exchange data. This distinction is fundamental to designing secure, scalable, and well-structured containerized applications. By understanding Docker networking principles, developers can effectively manage microservices architectures, enforce proper network segmentation, and enhance the security of their applications.
