_This project showcases the deployment of a Streamlit-based web application that seamlessly integrates with a PostgreSQL database, all within a Dockerized environment. The primary objective is to demonstrate how containerization can simplify application management, ensuring a consistent and reproducible workflow across different systems.

The Streamlit application serves as an interactive interface, allowing users to fetch, visualize, and analyze passenger data stored in the PostgreSQL database. By leveraging Docker, both the application and the database run in isolated yet interconnected containers, eliminating dependency conflicts and streamlining the setup process.

This approach ensures scalability, ease of deployment, and enhanced portability, making it ideal for real-world applications that require robust data handling and visualization._
